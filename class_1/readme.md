## Step 05: ‚ö° n8n Overview

1. Visit the **[n8n website](https://n8n.io/)** and **Sign up** using a Google account.
2. Create a **Workflow** to start your first project.

> **Note:** n8n trial expires in 14 days.

**Solution to extend trial:**

* Add `+1`, `+2`, `+3`, etc., before `@gmail.com` in your email. Example:

```
abcd@gmail.com
abcd+1@gmail.com
```

* This creates a ‚Äúnew‚Äù account for another 14-day trial.
* Your main inbox will still receive promotion emails; only the account is renewed.
